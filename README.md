This program is a custom-built command interface designed to change the way users interact with their computer. Inspired by the functionality of a traditional terminal, it allows users to execute commands and control their system — but with a completely redesigned interface that improves usability, appearance, and user experience.

Unlike standard terminals, this application offers a modern, customizable environment tailored to personal preferences, making command-based interaction more intuitive and enjoyable.
